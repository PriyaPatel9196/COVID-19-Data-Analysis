# COVID-19 Data Analysis
This repository contains the analysis performed on COVID-19 data, focusing on the conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths across different demographics and locations in the United States. The purpose of this analysis was to uncover insights into the factors contributing to COVID-19 mortality and provide data-driven recommendations for public health strategies and policy decisions.
## Project Overview
This project utilizes real-world data on COVID-19 deaths and contributing conditions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of this analysis was to understand the impact of various conditions on COVID-19 deaths, analyze geographical variations, and develop predictive models to support public health officials and policymakers in targeting interventions effectively.
## Repository Structure
This project files are divided between the following folders:
1. Project Management: Contains the project brief which outlines the objective and expectations of the analysis.
2. Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data and Prepared Data. These cintains the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size).
3. Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
4. Analysis: The Visualizations folder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
5. Sent to Client: Includes the Tableau Public storyboard as a PDF file.
## Key Questions
● What are the most common conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths is different age group?

● Which group have highest death and which conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths?

● Which states have highest specific conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths?

● What are the regional patterns and which region have highest COVID-19 deaths?

● Which month or season has highest COVID-19 deaths?

● How have COVID-19 death rates and contributing conditions changed over time?

● What factor are most predictive of COVID-19 death rates?
## Tools
● Python: Primary programming language used for data analysis.

● Panads: For data manipulation and analysis.

● NumPy: For numerical operations.

● Matplotlib & Seaborn: For generating data visualizations.
